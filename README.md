Question: How does the LRRK2 G2019S mutant, associated with Parkinson's Disease, affect the gene expression of lin-28 and RfC3 in the dopaminergic neurons of Drosophila fruit flies?
Hypothesis: If the LRRK2 G2019S mutant shows decreased gene expression in lin-28 and RfC3, then it may be possible that these genes contribute to loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons after LRRK2 G2019S expression.
